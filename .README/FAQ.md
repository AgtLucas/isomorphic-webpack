### How to differentiate between Node.js and browser environment?

Check for presence of `ISOMORPHIC_WEBPACK` variable.

Presence of `ISOMORPHIC_WEBPACK` indicates that code is executed using Node.js.

```js
if (typeof ISOMORPHIC_WEBPACK === 'undefined') {
	// Browser
} else {
	// Node.js
}
```

### How to enable logging?

`isomorphic-webpack` is using [`debug`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) to log messages.

To enable logging, export `DEBUG` environment variable:

```sh
export DEBUG=isomorphic-webpack:*
```
