### How to differentiate between Node.js and browser environment?

Check for presence of `ISOMORPHIC_WEBPACK` variable.

Presence of `ISOMORPHIC_WEBPACK` indicates that code is executed using Node.js.

```js
if (typeof ISOMORPHIC_WEBPACK === 'undefined') {
	// Browser
} else {
	// Node.js
}
```

### How to enable logging?

`isomorphic-webpack` is using [`debug`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) to log messages.

To enable logging, export `DEBUG` environment variable:

```sh
export DEBUG=isomorphic-webpack:*
```

### How to subscribe to compiler events?

Using `createIsomorphicWebpack` result has a `compiler` property. `compiler` is an instance of a webpack [`Compiler`](https://webpack.github.io/docs/node.js-api.html#compiler). Use it to subscribe to all compiler events, e.g.

Attempting to render a route server-side before the compiler has completed at least one compilation will produce an error. Therefore, it is desirable to delay the first server-side render until the compiler has completed at least one compilation.

```js
const {
  compiler
} = createIsomorphicWebpack(webpackConfiguration);

let routesAreInitialized;

compiler.plugin('done', () => {
  if (routesAreInitialized) {
    return;
  }

  routesAreInitialized = true;

  app.get('/', isomorphicMiddleware);
});

```

This pattern is demonstrated in the [isomorphic-webpack-demo](https://github.com/gajus/isomorphic-webpack-demo/blob/7f0e428ec85ef3ca6d39fd1916028817783754b2/src/bin/server.js#L29-L35).
